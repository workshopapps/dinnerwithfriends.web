            Catch Up is a new platform whose mission is to help people establish
            and maintain better relationships with those who matter most, and we
            are looking for the best and right people that can help us
            accomplish this. We value unique contributions, embrace diversity in
            people and ideas and welcome everyone. Weâ€™re a fully distributed,
            remote-first, fast-growing startup. Our engineering team is spread
            from UTC-8 to UTC+6 and we rely heavily on our written communication
            skills in order to make it work. We believe in giving our engineers
            agency and control over their schedules: we avoid standing meetings,
            and default to asynchronous communication. There are no core working
            hours, we just ask our team to communicate clearly about their
            schedules and be considerate to their coworkers if plans change. You
            will occasionally need to be flexible in order to meet synchronously
            with colleagues in different time zones.

          <p className="font-normal text-[12px] lg:text-[1rem] text-[#59595B] ">
            This is a full-time, fully-remote position as a Senior Backend
            Engineer. While we're very much still a startup in the sense that
            you may be asked to help with a variety of problems, in this role
            you can expect to spend most of your time working on the code and
            systems that power Catch Up.
            <ul className="list-disc">
              <li>
                You'll work closely with the Product, Data Science, and Finance
                teams and write code needed to power financial products for our
                customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Beyond specific product/application-related tasks, you will
                design and improve new tooling and systems as needed to support
                our application's needs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Revenue as a tradable asset is fundamentally a new problem --
                you'll develop familiarity with our business and help us explore
                the solution space. Ideas come from everywhere in our company;
                as a backend engineer, you will have a unique perspective on
                what kind of products are feasible and valuable.
              </li>
              <li>
                As an early team member, you will contribute significantly to
                our team culture.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a Senior engineer, we expect you to make the team better by
                writing code, but also by doing architecture work, mentoring
                other engineers, and generally improving the status quo.

          <p className="font-normal text-[12px] lg:text-[1rem] text-[#59595B] ">
            We are committed to using the right tools for the problems we are
            trying to solve. We are not dogmatic, but currently our stack is
            mostly comprised of:
            <ul className="list-disc">
              <li>Frontend: Typescript, React, Next.js.</li>
              <li>
                Backend: Go, PostgreSQL, Pyspark, BigQuery, Kubernetes, Pulumi,
                Buildkite, Google Cloud Platform,
              </li>
            </ul>
            You do not need to have prior experience with any of these
            technologies, most of us have learned them on the job. We believe
            great candidates are capable of learning new tools and we provide
            mentorship and guidance as needed.
            <br />
            We try to adopt tools that are a delight to use, and that help us be
            productive. We have a strong focus on always maintaining and
            improving developer productivity. We experiment frequently, but
            pragmatically, with new technology.

              <li>
