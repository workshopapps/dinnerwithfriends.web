# Catch-Up HNGi9 

What better way to have a scheduled hangout with your friends where you can unwind after a busy week, this is why we built 
catch and all in one platform that solves this problem.

<!-- ![screenshot](./src/images/screenshot.png)
My goal here is to Build a single page web application for metaverse using the React library, Click [here](https://metaverse-bnb.netlify.app/) to get a live preview of the project. -->

## Built With
- React Javascript
- TailwindCSS

### Prerequisites
The basic requirements for building the executable are:

- A working browser application (Google chrome, Mozilla Fire fox, Microsoft edge ...)
- VSCode or any other equivalent code editor
- NPM -Node Package Manager (For installing packages like Lighthous, webhint & stylelint used for checking for debugging bad codes before deployment)

# Getting Started

#### Cloning the project

```
git clone https://github.com/workshopapps/dinnerwithfriends.mobile.git
```
## Getting packages and dependencies
To get all package modules required to build the project run:
```
npm install
```
every package module required to build the project is listed in the package.json file. this is used as a reference to get all dependencies.

## Running

To run the program on a browser through a server run this command in your cli
```
npm start
```
This should open the page in your localhost on port 3000. then you'd be able to view the built page generated using webpack.

## Building

To build the project run:
```
npm run build
```
after you run this sucessfully you'd locate the build from in the ```build``` folder located from the parent directory of the project.

# Creating a Topical Branch
First, you will need to create a branch from the latest commit on master. Make sure your repository is up to date first using

git pull origin master

# Note: git pull does a git fetch followed by a git merge to update the local repo with the remote repo. For a more detailed explanation, see this stackoverflow post.

To create a branch, use git checkout -b <new-branch-name> [<base-branch-name>], where base-branch-name is optional and defaults to master. Creating a new branch called pull-request-demo from the master branch and push it to github.
 
git checkout -b pull-request-demo
git push origin pull-request-demo
